# endoSwitch

The R package estimates the endogenous switching regression model using full maximum likelihood estimation, *and* calculates treatment effects of a binary treatment. 

The function can replicate the regression results of the *movestay* command in STATA, though minor difference could occur due to differences in the optimization methods.
