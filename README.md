# endoSwitch

The R package estimates the endogenous switching regression model using full maximum likelihood estimation, *and* calculates treatment effects of a binary treatment. 

The function can replicate the regression results of the *movestay* command in STATA, though minor difference could occur due to differences in the optimization methods.

To install the package, run the following codes in R:

install.packages("devtools") # Run this if the devtools package is not installed.     
devtools::install_github("cbw1243/endoSwitch")  

Any feedback is welcome.
